# goog

goog is a command line tool that lets you perform Google searches from the
command line. Along with your query, you can specify the number of pages of
results you want and the time range you are interested in. 

You can output the result in simple, colored plain text in the shell, or you
can browse the results in Vim, where you are supplied with Vim key bindings to
quickly open any URL in the results in a web browser. 

goog can also install itself as a Vim plugin, giving you the power to run and
browse Google searches inside Vim. If you have `elinks` installed, you can even
read the webpages returned by the Google search inside your Vim session.

Pure command line mode:

goog in Vim mode. (Search command: `goog -v -d m boston hackathon`)

You can move the cursor on or before the link you want to
open in your browser, and then press `<leader>o` to open it.

```

## Motivation

I wrote `goog` for the same reason I wrote
[vmail](https://github.com/danchoi/vmail),
[poddb](http://danielchoi.com/software/poddb_client.html), and
[vitunes](https://github.com/danchoi/vitunes): I believe that the command line,
supplemented by a Unix-style plain text editor like Vim, is in general a much
more powerful, productive, empowering, and creative environment for using a
computer than the web browser is.


This is just the tip of the iceberg.
